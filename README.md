## Overview

### Link
[https://**`kekse.biz`**/](https://kekse.biz/)

### Status
*Finally* available in the World Wide Web!! It's Friday, 2023-10-27.. around midnight it was public. **:-)**

_There_ you can also read this API documentation, which is not really finished here; so that's a TODO item.
But a part is already online, see the link below ([Modules section](#modules)).

### **Modules**
See the [**Module INDEX**](docs/modules/README.md); much parts already described here (but still much TODO in here).

### **Index**
The [**source code** section](https://kekse.biz/?~sources) on [my website](https://kekse.biz/) acts as index/overview
and summary for the **lib**/ and **web**/ JavaScript sources. Here you shall see more than the
[API documentation / Module Index](docs/modules/README.md) linked above.

I re-generate them from time to time via my [**index.js**](js/index.js) script. Feel free to execute it with `-? / --help`
or `-d / --debug` parameter. It depends on the library part of this project, btw.

### **Updates** and **Backups**
So I designed my *second version* of my [**`git.sh`**](sh/git.sh), inside the **root** of my own
**www** git repository.. if you deploy this site on your own, it'd be recommended to also create
such a base repository (for any of your htdocs/).

So now I can [**`fresh`.sh**](https://github.com/kekse1/scripts/#freshsh) everything, and directly
create some (of many...) backups, and execute helper scripts like the [**`index`.sh**](#index) (see
above).

### **TODO**
It can be found on my website, look at [**this link**](https://kekse.biz/?~todo).

### Counter script
See also my own [**`count.php`**](https://github.com/kekse1/count.php/), which is being used in here..

### Configuration
I'm massively using **CSS Custom Properties** (so CSS styles with `--` prefix) to configure
any behavior of my website. See my [**`config.css`**](css/config.css)!
