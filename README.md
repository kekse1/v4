## Overview

### Status
Theoretically I could already present my site (though the contents itself are not really ready,
but from the technical site..). But I'm fine tuning many features right now, and I also wanted
to present a finished documentation right here. So I'm still waiting.

### Modules
See the [Module Index](docs/modules/README.md).

> **Note**
> I'm using the newer `ES Modules` here (the first time for me). Because they're asynchronous etc.,
> whereas my older versions used an own `require()` implementation (which had to be synchronous,
> for obvious reasons).
