# **getopt**
Nice design.. and It's already working great (seems to be finished).

## Reference
I'm referring you to my special [`getopt.js` github repository page](https://github.com/kekse1/getopt.js/).

There are all features listed, there's also a polyfill as replacement for my library functions from here,
and the documentation is also done /there/.
