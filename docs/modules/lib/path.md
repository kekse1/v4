# `path`
Similar to the regular [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)\` version, and will also be
overridden if using Node.js.

But it was important for the BROWSER, so I implemented it.

The `path.extname()` won't be overridden by Node.js since my version is better! ;-)

All functions also support URL's.

## Differences

### `path.extname()`
This stays my own version, which can read an integer argument to define the amount
and the direction of multiple extensions, if given.

### `path.equal()`
Especially when some paths end with slash **`/`** and other's won't..

### /TODO/
