# Web Animations API
There are some problems with the native implementation. So I implemented some more logics,
inclusive features for better animation handling. All totally managed!

All my extensions are implemented straight into the `Animation(.prototype)` object (and,
of course, the `HTMLElement.prototype.animate`), so you don't need to remember/care about
other functions or smth.

//TODO/..
