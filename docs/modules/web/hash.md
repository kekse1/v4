# `class URLHash`
Maybe with using URL's `#hash` component like the `?search` component, **but**
atm it seems better to use them they way I use them _now_!

## Function
Is used to handle hash portion changes (without reloading the whole thing),
which is quite useful these days (.. so my **CMS::1**). This depends on my
[`page.js`](page.md).

The [`page.js`](page.md) also used one class function to manipulate the
whole location in your web browser, to dynamically change it.
