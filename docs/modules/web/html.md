# **`class DOMParser`**
Parses HTML code (mostly loaded by the [`page.js`](page.md)), and more.

Using the `DOMParser` als our extended base we also filter out only the `<body>` part
of loaded HTML files, so they'll be integrated into the web design (mostly my `#MAIN`
base design element).

Additionally filtering out some nodes, and more. Some are loaded/handled later.
